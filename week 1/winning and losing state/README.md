# Game Strategy: Winning and Losing States

In this game, states can be classified as either **winning** states or **losing** states:

- A **winning state** is a state where the player will win the game if they play optimally.
- A **losing state** is a state where the player will lose the game if the opponent plays optimally.

### Analyzing the Game

The game involves removing sticks from a heap. The goal is to force the opponent into a **losing state**. Below is a breakdown of states and their classification:

- **State 0**: Clearly a losing state because the player cannot make any moves. 
- **States 1, 2, and 3**: Winning states because the player can remove 1, 2, or 3 sticks and win the game.
- **State 4**: Losing state because any move results in a winning state for the opponent.

### General Rule

- If there is a move that leads from the current state to a losing state, the current state is a **winning state**.
- Otherwise, the current state is a **losing state**.

### Classification of States

The states of the game from 0 to 15 are classified below (W denotes a **winning state**, and L denotes a **losing state**):

| States | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Result | L  | W  | W  | W  | L  | W  | W  | W  | L  | W  | W  | W  | L  | W  | W  | W  |

### Observations

- A state `k` is a **losing state** if `k` is divisible by 4.
- Otherwise, it is a **winning state**.

### Optimal Strategy

To play the game optimally:
1. Always choose a move that leaves the opponent in a state where the number of sticks is divisible by 4.
2. Continue this strategy until there are no sticks left, and the opponent loses.

**Note**: If the number of sticks is divisible by 4 at the start of your turn, there is no winning strategy, and the opponent will win if they play optimally.
